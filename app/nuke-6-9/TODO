PHP-NUKE: Web Portal System
===========================

For the Next few Versions you can expect:

- Groups Management
- Maybe a new News module
- Open Directory backend

For the future versions I'll add some cool features, basicaly:

- Freshmeat reverse engineer module
- File Sharing module
- Gnutella frontend module
- Glossary
- Themes Builder
- Quotes system
- Walk in the code to add/remove shit when needed
- Better and 100% "working" moderation system
- Some other cool features. Do you have any ideas on how to improve PHP-Nuke?

If you have any ideas, modification, suggestion, etc, please email me.
Where? Good question... dig around... (Francisco Burzi)
