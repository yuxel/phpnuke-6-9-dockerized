- Added a nice feature to let you have custom modules by theme. This means that you can have a totaly 100%
  different modules for each theme. How? Just create a "modules" directory inside a theme's directory and copy
  your new modules there. For example: If you want the theme NukeNews to have its own custom News module,
  you need to have a directory "/themes/NukeNews/modules/News" and the News replace on it. The system will
  automaticaly detect and load it instead of the default "/modules/News". Remember to fix all your path in the
  module files. See Sand_Journey theme directory for an example with Addon_Sample module.

  (Thanks to Paul Laudanski of http://ComputerCops.biz for the suggestion)

  and admin loops also.
- Added new registered users stats/count for today/yesterday in administration menu
- Added a new feature to let you decide if you want a module's name and link will be visible in Modules block
- Now each theme can load its own default home module. Just create a module.php file under the theme's
  directory with the variable $default_module on it. For an example please see Sand_Journey theme. It loads
  News module. Try changing the default home module from administration and notice that the News module
  continues to be loaded in the homepage only for this theme. If you don't want to have or use this feature
  just don't have any module.php file in your theme's directory.
- Fixed headlines bug that did not let you had less than 10 news from a XML/RSS news feed.

  You can still use as usual, or you can call it like: http://yoursite.com/backend.php?cat=themes
  The above URL will show the XML formated file only with "themes" category. Note the variable "cat". So
  now people from other sites can retrieve from your site only the news they have really interest in.
  Of course that this feature will works only if you have set one or more news categories for your site.
- Changed the password generator function in Your_Account due to problems in some systems.
- Automatic installation added. Not more sql server shell commands to install. Just edit your config.php
  and point the browser to your web site. The system automaticaly will add the database and tables on the

  getting all directories as valid themes. For example, if you have a directory called CVS, it will not be taken
  as a valid theme with this new feature.
- List of users benefits from Your Account module in new user registration page is now updated automaticaly
  depending on what you have active and for registered users only.
- Added new feature to have theme sensitive topic's graphics (in /themes/your_theme/images/topics/). Default topics
  graphics need to be on usual place (/images/topics/) but if the system find the existence of the files in the
  theme's images directory it will show it instead. This was higly requested feature. Themes files need to be
  modified to have this feature working. Please look at the included themes to have some samples.

- Fixed bad width in two graphics of statistics bars

- Changed all default icons for users page in Your_Account module. Not only that, but each theme can have
  different icons for user's menu and WebMail if the graphics files exists and if not the system will
  load the default graphics. Refer to some themes like 3D-Fantasy, Odyssey, ExtraLite, Sand_Journey and NukeNews
  to see the difference and look at the new /images/directory structure. Basicaly /images/menu/ and /images/webmail
  will load the user's menu and WebMail icons respectively if specific file names exists. Take a look.
  All new icons are used with author's permission, please see CREDITS file for more information.
- Added a new link metatag to configure the browser icon for your site. To have it working you need
  to have a file called favicon.ico inside /themes/your_theme/images/ directory.

- Detailed statistics now count and show the new impression when accessing it.
- Added a new feature that lets you have decoration in the Survey bars. In theme/Your_Theme/images directory you
  can have three more files: survey_leftbar.gif, survey_mainbar.gif and survey_rightbar.gif If you don't have them
  the system automaticaly selects the usual bars files (leftbar.gif, mainbar.gif and rightbar.gif). Additionaly you
  can have another file called "survey_mainbar_d.gif" (see the "_d"). This graphic, if exists, will be added each
  25% in the survey bar. This can help you to decorate your Survey bars. Statistics bars are the usual ones. Try it!
- Fixed user session save function before show left blocks
- Solved the looooong dilema about Module's Copyright information. There is a new file called "copyright.php"
  in the module's directory. Please take a look at /modules/Addon_Sample/ and see this file. Modules/Addons
  developers can edit this file filling the required data and then copy this file into your module's directory.
  To see it working just go to Addon Sample module and look the little copyright stick at the bottom right of
  the module's table. If you don't put this file into the module's directory nobody will see that stick. Hope
  users play fair on this and solved a big user's issue about the copyright messages.
- Added 5 new themes and changed the default one from NukeNews to Sand_Journey
- Added a very nice feature to allow registered users to publish Public Messages which will be available in any
  page of the site to other users for a period of 10 minutes. Each message can be viewed just one time per user
  and any registered user can also turn off this feature from its preferences page. To have this feature working
  you need to use the new function "public_message()" located in mainfile.php and need to be added where you want
  it in your themes files. The function returns $public_msg with all the needed stuff (table, colors, message, etc).
  You can see samples of how to use it by viewing the default system themes. All themes that comes with PHP-Nuke 6
  supports this feature.

February 2002: Version 5.5
==========================
- Added a very cool function to check if a module is activated. Call it: is_active("Module_Name");

  $module_name = basename(dirname(__FILE__));
  get_lang($module_name);
