        $result=sql_query("select pwd, admlanguage from "$prefix."_authors  where aid='$aid'", $dbi);
        list($pass, $admlanguage)=sql_fetch_row($result, $dbi);
        if($pass == $pwd) {
            $admin = base64_encode("$aid:$pwd:$admlanguage");
            setcookie("admin", "$admin",time()+7200);
            unset($op);
        }
    }
}</PRE
><P
>As you see we have modified the life duration of the second cookie from 2592000 (a month) to 7200 seconds (two hours). As you can easily see, we have reduced the action radius of the script kiddie down from one month to two hours.</P

>A much more effective tag filter is in the study phase, although for the moment, the proposed solutions did give a definitive answer to the problem. The admissible tags are defined in in the file config.php in the variable &dollar;AllowableHTML<A
NAME="AEN2214"
></A
>, these are valid for the comments and the insertion of news in the function check_html()<A
