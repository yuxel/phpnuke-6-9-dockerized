>PHP-Nuke is a free software, released under the <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html"
TARGET="_top"
>GNU  GPL License</A
>, version 2.0. PHP-Nuke is the result of many years administrating a news site called <A
HREF="http://linuxpreview.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux Preview</A
>. First, around August 1998, I wrote my own code in Perl called NUKE and used it for about 1 year, then my site grew big, so I needed a more powerfull system and decided to use Slash, the same used in the <A
HREF="http://www.slashdot.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Slashdot</A
> site. It's good, but you realy need to know Perl to modify it, need too many modules, need to load a damn daemon that sucks all your CPU power. My Pentium III just appears to be a 386 each minute the daemon make its work.</P
><P
>Well, then I discovered Thatware, a good project to have a news site under PHP. I learned PHP in less than a week and began modifying it. There are too many mods to mention, it was practicaly a rewrite. I added some cool stuff, deleted some others and after more than 380 hours of hard work in 3 weeks! PHP-Nuke was born.</P
><P
>On August 17, 2000 I sold LinuxPreview.org to LinuxAlianza.com and now I have all the time to dedicate to the development of PHP-Nuke.</P
><P
>From January 2001 to January 2002, PHP-Nuke has been financially supported by MandrakeSoft, the folks that made Mandrake Linux. This gave me and PHP-Nuke a lot of oxygen and made possible a lot of stuff.</P
><P
>Now, I'm alone with this killer project. There is a lot of help from the people that use and develop modules and themes. Now, <A
HREF="http://phpnuke.oeg"
TARGET="_top"
>phpnuke.org</A
> is a big site with a lot of users and helpful information for any user around the world. There are also strong users community sites in almost any language you can imagine. Just go to <A
HREF="http://phpnuke.oeg"

>phpnuke.org</A
> and enjoy this great community! </P
